# RTRM-Flask
Engineering tools in python with a UI in flask

A proof of concept for a web interface for python scripts written for engineering purposes. Most of the code is taken from this tutorial:
http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-web-app-from-scratch-using-python-flask-and-mysql--cms-22972

Following frameworks are used on top of Python:
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for the UI framework
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to present the UI nicely
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to post and display form data

A running sample can be found at http://avni.pythonaywhere.com

Please be gentle and don't try to break it.
